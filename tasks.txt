[ TASKS ]
*A. (average) Integrate yolo code to existing codeintegrate yolo code to existing code
*B. (light) Improve preprocessing (resize, rotate) - put it to a function for reusability
*C.1 (average) Preprocess A: Extract foreground from frame, clean noise from foreground, perform morphological transformation (implement as function for reusability, input: foreground mask, output: enhanced foreground)
*C.2 (average) Preprocess B: Extract background from frame, blur/supress edges from background shape (implement as function for reusability, input: background mask, output: enhanced background)
*D. (average) Merge modified foreground and background. Integrate Task B, C.1, and C.2 to the YOLO loop
*E. (heavy) Workon direction tracking of human objects, work inside YOLO main loop
*F. (heavy) Determine/alert objects that changes direction significantly, works inside YOLO main loop
*G. (light) Revise paper (Intro, Related Works, Methodology) put it to overleaf
*H. (light) Draft the results and discussion
*I. (average) Draft the conclusion and recommendation
*J. (average) Final formatting of paper (citation, figures, etc)
*K. (light) Final proofreading of paper
*L. (average) Prepare presentation slides, compile video output for each step for presentation (get vid from each tasks)
